# ChessGame
Hello! My name is Krish Govind and this is my first ever project. This project is essentially going to be coding Chess in python, 
but also having an AI to play against using an algorithim. This project is currently a WIP and will most likely be done in the
far future. This project is more of a passion/learning project than anything else, especially since python is not my main language.
